# SmartBuy - E-Commerce website for selling Electronics
This is a project for CSCI-P 565 Software Engineering course. As a group of 4 people we designed and developed online retail store with features including login and registration, buyer, seller and admin roles, categories, search, filters, shopping cart and payment. We used technologies like Nodejs, MongoDB, Bootstrap and followed Agile methodology.
